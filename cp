The cp command - copy files

the cp command allows us to essentially make a copy of a file and name it something else. 
The cp command takes two parameters just like the mv command. The first being the file to copy and the second being the name of the new file.

For example: 

cp oldFile newFile

This would make a copy of the oldFile, called newFile.
