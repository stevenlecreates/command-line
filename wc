The Wc Command - Word Count

The wc command allows us to check a file for it's number of lines, words and characters. 

There are switches within the wc command that allow you to search for each invidiual number (lines, words, or characters) by itself.

For example:

wc -l counts the number of lines
wc -c counts the number of characters
wc -w counts the number of words

wc newFile

would give us the number of lines, words and characters that are in newFile
