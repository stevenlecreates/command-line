The mv command - move files 

the mv command allows you to move a file from one directory to another.
It accpets two parameters with the first one being the file we want to move and the second being the location we want to move it to.
For example: 

mv oldfile ../desktop

would move the oldfile from it's current directory to the desktop directory.
